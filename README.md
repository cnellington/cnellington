### Howdy ðŸ‘‹
I create trustworthy intelligent systems for personalized medicine. 
I'm a Computational Biology PhD student at CMU advised by Dr. Eric Xing.

#### Current Interests
High resolution medical imaging and sequencing have revealed unexpected differences among cohorts of patients with identical diseases and characteristics. 
This heterogeneity requires the focus of medicine to shift from populations to patients.
I create systems that generate patient-specific models of disease to understand how a patient's molecular profile influences their disease's manifestation, progression, and outcome.
Currently, I work with [@blengerich](https://github.com/blengerich) on inferring gene regulatory networks under a one-patient-one-sample regime.
