### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Research Scientist at [GenBio AI](https://genbio.ai/).

Previously: [SAILING Lab](https://sailing-lab.github.io/) / [Genesis Therapeutics](https://genesistherapeutics.ai/) / [Baker Lab](https://www.bakerlab.org/) / [Indeed](https://indeed.com/) / [Klavins Lab](http://klavinslab.org/) / [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)

I work on AI/ML for biology to enable automated biomarker discovery, drug repurposing, and therapeutic target identification for heterogeneous and rare diseases. 
My research interests span foundation models, probabilistic graphical models, biological modeling, and multi-task learning.

Recently, I've been working on [AIDO.ModelGenerator](https://genbio-ai.github.io/ModelGenerator/), an opinionated plug-and-play research framework for cross-disciplinary teams in ML & Bio, promoting the use of foundation models in research. 
AIDO.ModelGenerator is designed to enable rapid and reproducible prototyping with new data, new foundation models, new finetuning tasks, and new architectures, all while automatically scaling with hardware and integrating with larger data pipelines for research and production.

I also co-created [contextualized.ml](https://contextualized.ml/), an SKLearn-style toolbox for estimating and analyzing models, distributions, and functions with context-specific parameters.
I made Contextualized to enable per-patient or per-cell analysis of biomedical data, and create truly personalized models for healthcare, precision diagnostics, and drug repurposing.
See papers using Contextualized in the repo.

I also enjoy rock climbing, running, backpacking, guitar, learning languages, and wild speculation about Spotifyâ€™s recommender system. Iâ€™ve lived in Austin TX, Seattle WA, and Pittsburgh PA and I call them all home.
